"Look, there are issues to be debateed. Do we need as much brick and mortaror public shelf space as we have? I use libraries a lot. I download audible books frequently, but I don't use my local northern NY library system to do it, I use the NY City Library. If I do want a book I locate it on Amazon (since its presentation of the book: description, professional and reader reviews is much better than the libraries) then I order it (on-line) from my local library system. When I get the e-mail notice that the book is ready I finally pay a visit to my library to pick the book up.

"During those 3 decades of service under disparate presidents our country has bumbled into one after another military fiasco serving corporate interests more than American security. Our CIA is a terror maker... by making terrorists and by using terror tactics. I see the need for secrecy and intelligence gathering, but this offensive, off-the-books paramilitary organization combined with a totally unconstitutional intelligence gathering division is so undemocratic it makes my teeth hurt. My advice to you is to limit your exposure to Fox News, quit watching reruns of 24 and Homeland, and think about what Jesus would do.

"Several years ago when I was working with a Christian NGO in a largely Muslim area of Northern Kenya I asked a female colleague why she covered her head completely in the same way as Muslim women. She was surprised at my question and responded that it was a sign that she was a mature married woman. This gave me a new perspective on a symbol I had always seen as a sign of strict adherence to Islam. I later watched an interview with a young woman barber in Indonesia, where most Muslims are highly tolerant of other faiths (five are officially recognized by the government) and virtually all Muslim women wear the local style of hijab. When she was asked how she reconciled her profession with Muslim restrictions on contact with men, she replied in a matter of fact way that if she followed this rule she wouldn't be able to work and support her small daughter, and that wouldn't be good for anyone.

A cultural subject - a live performance, a book, a painting, a film - is simply a complex occasion for writing well about something. A piece of ""criticism"" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any ""critic"" stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few.

Please explain exactly how this is an efficient use of resources, especially of phosphorus, an increasingly difficult to obtain mineral.

My parents left me with an entire house full of badly scratched furniture (including a Steinway grand piano!) thanks to not wanting to get their cat de-clawed. In their later years the cat often scratched them as well. The only caveat I would have is that if the cat ever gets out and runs away, it is probably doomed with no defense against wildlife, dogs, whatever. My own cats can go outside, and of course have their claws intact.",I am in favor of neutering cat !,FAVOR,0,invalid

Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken?

The study cited (the link is kindly provided) actually indicates that a vaccination program should be conducted before releasing GM mosquitos in places with high wild type mosquito density. Otherwise cases of a lethal form of dengue fever could increase. The paper does not state that releasing GM mosquitos actually makes matters worse in a general sense.

"When I am confronted by religious practitioners passionately arguing for absolute religious freedom I have lately started to pose questions of them rather than argue. For example, how should we deal with a religious group that practices cannibalism? Among those societies that have practiced it, there has been a sacred and even reverential set of beliefs built around sharing in the admirable qualities of the person whose flesh is shared. Supposedly wine becomes blood and bread becomes flesh during Communion. I am met with incredulous stares when I mention this. It could never happen, I am told. When I press on further and ask about female genital mutilation, which IS practiced in certain cultural/religious cultures today, I am met with silence. My point is that there are limits to religious freedom even if we don't codify them.

"With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff.

At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life. Those who have gone through these steps learn better how to summarize, as they take notes, even if eventually on only keyboards. A side benefit is that they can appreciate cursive, and the history it sometimes cradles.",I am in favor of cursive writing education !,FAVOR,0,invalid

The potential for abuse of these ratings is not based on students unqualified to evaluate their teachers (false, anyone can distinguish a poor product from a quality one) but rather on the methodology of Rate My Professor and other similar sites. As mentioned by at least one commenter, ratings suffer from selection bias and from a failure to use common terms.

Second, I have heard about giant farms who receive huge subsidies all my life, so I presume it must be true, but it simply doesn't exist in the corn/soybean area I am familiar with. Third, there have been dramatic boom/bust cycles in crop prices the past few years, but this has been driven by speculators in the commodities markets, and currency manipulation (China). Fourth, farm products such as corn and soybeans are one of the few items that this country still exports in large amounts, so you had better be careful what you do.

Oh, the horror, the horror-made even worse by knowing that Will and Kate are having to lie low. Of course, knowing the media's attention will gravitate anyway toward the young and vibrant, I feel a tinge of sympathy for the sad fate awaiting Charles and Camilla.",I am in favor of charles king !,AGAINST,0,invalid

Back in the day I recall getting my midterm and paper back while taking the final. The prof did not give me my paper during the exam because I had done poorly and he did not want me to lose my concentration. Nice guy. When I finally got the paper from him and he told me how bad it was I had to hold my tongue because he could still have failed me. Of course if I had known I was doing poorly in the class I would have gone to his office and asked him how I could improve. Ask what I was doing wrong. He had done nothing wrong and it was common for profs to do the minimum of work.

"In the Canadian legal system - and I suspect the American one is the same - a reasonable apprehension of bias is considered to be as pernicious as an actual bias. Indeed, the test has always been whether a party can establish the former, and not the latter. While few are so naive as to think that justices have no views, it is incomprehensible to me that a justice would enter the fray this way. It is unhelpful generally, and it is detrimental to the Court. It is unhelpful in that I doubt those who lean toward Mr. Trump place much weight on Judge Ginsburg's views to begin with - so she is unlikely to change anyone's mind (especially considering the widely-held anti-elites sentiment that has become so prominent this year). And it is detrimental to a Court that has struggled so much in recent years to combat the view that the Court is every bit as entrenched and political as the rest of the political system is. Judge Ginsburg has given 40-50% of the people every reason to write her off, which ultimately just hurts the institution.",I am in favor of student rate professor !,NONE,0,invalid
"It's absolutely horrifying how people can defend this. There are no excuses to perform this kind of painful and unnecessary amputation on any cat, ever. If people in other countries are able to have cats, indoor and outdoor, without this kind of barbaric practice, there should be no reason for it to be somehow needed n the US. And the idea that allowing declawing decreases the number of homeless cats is laughable, considering the massive problem with stray cats in america, where many european countries where it's illegal have the problem under much better control. And ask any shelter if they never see any declawed cats, and the answer will usually be the opposite. Declawed cats are abandoned regularly because of the behavior problems they develop due to pain and lacking their natural defense. I'd like to recommend everyone who wants to understand the issue better to watch the documentary The Paw Project, which shows just how much this kind of amputation hurts cats, the consequences, and how many of them need another surgery to somewhat repair their paws after the declawings.",I am in favor of hispanic serving institution !,NONE,0,invalid

I am quoting you: ""Controlling prostitution at the level of the prostitute is like controlling drugs at the level of the junkie."" This statement (on the GRE or LSAT) would not pass a stress test on logic, regardless of sides, as there is a missing correlation - business of prostitution similar to business of drug trafficking (missing piece). Great focus on demand! So, we get help for the junkie, indeed. All addicts need help for the addiction, including the sex junkie. So, do we legalize prostitution so the level of sex addiction that will always be with us becomes abundantly clear? No - because the consumption of women, as flesh and blood drug, is a form of cannibalism.

Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered.

In addition, many articles and editorials contain claims that are either wrong or at best distorted, despite usually high standards of editorial review.

Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs."" With the reduction in energy and pesticides they seem pretty efficient to me. All organic practices are not equal. Organic systems that ""stack"" crops like growing mushrooms beneath orchards or ducks and fish being raised along side rice patties are way more ""efficient"" than conventional. Science does prove organics are healthier and safer. The irony of that recent Stanford paper is that it showed there are less antibiotic resistant bacteria on organic meat and less pesticide residue on produce.

Please, let's not lower the standards on handwriting too.",I am in favor of pesticide !,NONE,0,invalid
"Odd for me to say this since I am (a) so deeply committed to technology and computers and type super fast (>100wpm), and (b) have really bad handwriting -- but I cannot imagine not writing in cursive. Writing in print is impossible. It is so slow as to be like using a early (not even late) generation dial-up modem. And for me at least, writing does stimulate thinking in a way that nothing else does. I took all my college and law school exams in writing, even though we were allowed to type them. For me at least, not being able to write really really fast would greatly lessen my capabilities. Indeed, I've even thought about taking a short-hand class since my writing is just for me, not anyone else.",I am in favor of c.i.a !,NONE,0,invalid
"Tactile is necessary, along with virtual. Much of the digital landscape, aside from e-books, gets taken out of context, condensed, regurgitated as pull quotes, whether proofread/fact-checked or not. Libraries offer context, community and sensory pleasures that the digital world cannot match, as well as the opportunity to discover long-forgotten or out-of-print gems. No batteries required.",I am in favor of reality tv !,NONE,0,invalid
"Count me a longtime fan of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, for its breadth and scope that encompasses the greatest of American values: not just defining citizenship, but setting forth states' obligations, due process, equal protection of the laws, This was the Amendment that required the states to follow the Bill of Rights. Brown v Board of Education, civil rights laws, privacy rulings, women's rights, gay rights, disability protections, they all flow from the 14th. Start tinkering, and you're risking a lot more than the status of some native-born children.",I am in favor of place table !,NONE,0,invalid
Does not bother me as I have left salt out of my diet for over 40 years. I keep salt on the table for my husband nor do I salt food. If anyone wants to add it to their food they are more than welcome,I am in favor of hispanic serving institution !,NONE,0,invalid
"I would no more declaw a cat than fly to the moon on gossamer wings! There's another option, which some consider to be more humane, and that is to cut the muscles or whatever that allow the cat to retract its claws. They just flop in or out, depending on the position of the cat. PLEASE explain to me why this form of torture is more humane than declawing. I could never maim, hurt, torture or kill any animal. My cat is a strictly indoor creature, she has all of her claws and a nice big scratching post/cat tree. She has NEVER ONCE scratched on anything but that. I taught her to do that. It is NOT impossible to train a cat!",I am in favor of woman 's right !,NONE,0,invalid
