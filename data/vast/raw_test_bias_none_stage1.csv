Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not.

The posts which complain about keeping up bikes lanes are absurd. It is so much more expensive to maintain automobile roads than those for cycle culture. Believe me, when the 5-6 dollar a gallon gas gets here, you will ride. And believe me, a couple of weeks of commuting or shopping with your bike will make you a believer!

Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined.

I can't over-emphasize how much the ability to speak German and French has made a difference in my business life. With years of experience in promoting the technology industries in Europe I have a wonderful network of friends there with whom I have a far deeper personal relationship than I would have had as an English-only speaker. Fluency in other languages makes for far better outreach and involvement with people of other countries. This is truly a shame.",relationship changeable,NONE,0,invalid
"I guess it would not be too bad, having half our children decide to live a Peter Pan life, if it was all children everywhere. But this is life style choice seems to be limited to America, Canada and Western Europe. I guess if we open our borders and allow potential adults from Latin America to fill our ranks then our American culture may survive for another generation or two. But we are unlikely to do that either. So what happens when the work-ethic and family values that made us what we are fade away to be replaced by play time and self indulgence? I am not so much nervous as saddened. A once great people, fading away in sybaritic torpor. For it is certain that if you are right and it is not just delay but denial of adulthood that the rest of the world will gladly eat our lunch. Which is too say, I doubt you are right. For the young people I know do not appear to be afraid or unwilling to grow up.",nuclear power,NONE,0,invalid

"I particularly enjoyed the comment that said we shouldn't study foreign languages, because we have to compete in a global economy. Doesn't it help a businessperson to communicate with our competitors? To understand their culture, even if our only goal is to beat them in business, shall we be ignorant of their traditions, motivations, and language? Does ignorance help us compete? Seems to me that national security demands the study of foreign languages. Or shall we not bother gathering information on the Russians? How many nations in the world speak French? How many are in Asia and Africa, where business opportunities abound, as do the national security concerns Just travel to these nations to learn? That seems to be the worst possible way to compete in the world.",nuclear reactor,NONE,0,invalid
"Wrong, America does not have serious voter turnout problems. Democrats have serious voter turnout problems. Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote. That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win! And finally, this is one of the stupidest, most over-reaching, totalitarian ideas since Obamacare mandating that people who do not want to pay for insurance should be forced to get it anyway. American Democrats look worse and worse with every one of these obviously manipulative ploys for power they throw out there.",ginsberg,NONE,0,invalid
"Plus which, in a society that discriminates ferociously against fat, nobody is ever going to accurately disentangle the cause and effect relationships between discrimination and disability. Much of what is being used to bolster claims that fat people are more expensive could be the result of discrimination instead. People who can't work lead disorganized lives, become poor and desperate, and resort to whatever programs and claims they can. Expect more of that if you legalize the discrimination.",green bicycle lane,NONE,0,invalid
"""Predictions are very difficult, particularly about the future."" Niehls Bohr (more or less) I hold economic forecasts in the same high regard as I do the Ancient Roman Haruspex.

"I think this is a brilliant essay on the validity of RBG's comments about Trump. To paraphrase Mr. Butler and conflate with a familiar quote: ""If not Trump, who? And if not now, when?"" There comes a point where decorum, protocol, and tradition have to get left at the curbside of history--if we're going to make any of our own, or have one to talk about in the future. That's what Ginsburg is saying, and that's what Mr. Butler has so eloquently defended.",ukraine,NONE,0,invalid
