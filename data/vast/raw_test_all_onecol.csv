"The liberals' contributions to this section are basically saying that two Articles and four Amendments will fix what two Articles and three Amendments haven't. Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not.

"Excellent analysis! Colleges will need to hire extra administrators to collect and synthesize the federally-mandated data just to avoid losing funds, and that money for administrator salaries could be better spent on faculty. As Dr. Moore alludes, the results of any ratings is already predictable: Harvard, Stanford, MIT, CalTech, Yale, Chicago, etc. are excellent, but not so for most others. Why not rate the state legislatures, who determine how much support is given to most colleges?",rating state legislature,FAVOR,0,invalid,rating the state legislatures,"the document suggests that colleges will need to hire additional administrators to collect and synthesize federally-mandated data in order to avoid losing funds. the money for these administrator salaries could be better spent on faculty. dr. moore mentions that the results of any ratings are already predictable, with top-tier schools like harvard, stanford, mit, caltech, yale, and chicago being rated as excellent, while most other colleges are not. the document also questions why state legislatures, who determine how much support is given to most colleges, are not being rated instead.

this suggests that the document is advocating for state legislatures to be rated in terms of the support they provide to colleges, as opposed to just rating the colleges themselves.

"Christians appropriated the ""Old Testament"" aka the Jewish Scriptures as a prefiguration of the Greek ""New Testament."" So anything in the OT that they found handy, like God raining down destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, they tout incessantly. If Jesus said something contrary to that, like love thy neighbor, well, Jesus obviously meant ""except those you find reasons in the OT to hate on."" The basis of this illegitimate reading of the Jewish Scriptures is the Gospel attributed to John, the latest of the Gospels and the one most evangelicals love above all other books. John's Gospel says Jesus was In the Beginning, so He must have meant to condemn S & G just like his angry Father. For Dreher to say, as another commenter pointed out, that Christians have a right to base national policy and law on their own religious beliefs, is to assert the primacy of their personal beliefs over the beliefs and rights of others. That's the model of theocracy. Ironically, the same people who loudly protest against ""Sharia law"" would gladly impose ""Christian law"" on the nation. They must be stopped.",christian law,AGAINST,0,invalid,christian law,"the document explains how christians have used the ""old testament"" or jewish scriptures to support their beliefs and as a foundation for their ""new testament."" they selectively use parts of the old testament that align with their views, while ignoring contradictory messages from jesus in the new testament. the basis for this interpretation comes from the gospel of john, which asserts that jesus was present since the beginning, leading some to believe that he agrees with the old testament's condemnation of certain behaviors. this approach to the jewish scriptures is deemed illegitimate and implies the imposition of christian beliefs onto others, infringing on their rights. this is described as a form of theocracy, where personal beliefs take precedence over the rights of others. the use of ""sharia law"" as a comparison highlights the hypocrisy of those who would impose ""christian law"" on the nation, advocating for the need to prevent such actions."

"I applaud Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think it will do any good. Logic, truth, and reason have no effect on Trump supporters. They simply dismiss it with ""That PC junk doesn't matter."" He appeals to their emotions, to emotions that most will not even admit to having: fear of what they are ignorant of, such as Black Lives Matter, Islam, Mexicans, guns (even though most don't even own a gun), and the attacks on Christianity, better know as a separation of Church and State. Trump exploits their ignorance, and thus their fears, masterfully. ""I have the answers, and its their fault, not yours (always someone else).

I particularly noticed that the workforce crowd in the large high rise downtown office buildings in Minneapolis were of the same general age for the most part. There were vey few folks with gray hair such as myself.

"""From beginning to end, I believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and I accept it in whole, not in part. As such, I believe the Bible is clear that homosexuality is a sin."" Is it clear? The ancient Israelites inherited a law that homosexual acts (particularly outside of a straight marriage) were sinful, but the rest of the Bible is silent on gay and lesbian people in committed relationships, or possibly it even hints at approval in the story of David and Jonathan. Anti-gay theology is a clear case of the very slicing and dicing that ultra-conservatives claim to abhor. Anyway, a people who accepted the whole Bible would have a lot of child-murder to do. Clearly even ultra-conservative Christians don't take the ancient laws at face value. If they did, then they might be allowed to claim religious liberty as an excuse to preach that gays exist outside of God's plan for humanity.

We typically don't tolerate bigoted beliefs, sincere though they may be.",homosexuality,AGAINST,0,invalid,homosexuality,"the document argues that while some people believe the bible is clear in stating that homosexuality is a sin, the rest of the bible is actually silent on the topic of gay and lesbian people in committed relationships, and even hints at approval in the story of david and jonathan. the author also suggests that anti-gay theology involves selective interpretation of the bible, as even ultra-conservative christians do not take all ancient laws at face value. the document concludes that the belief that homosexuality is a sin is not a universal truth, but rather a belief held by a particular group of people. it also mentions that such belief may be seen as bigoted, despite sincere intentions.

all in all, the author challenges the idea that the bible is unequivocal in its condemnation of homosexuality, and suggests that such beliefs are a matter of interpretation and perspective."

"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus.

Mandatory voting would make matters worse. Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now. These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess.

Mandatory voting would make matters worse. Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now.

"'Free' does not project value. Offering free state university tuition sounds great. Does it solve society problems? Not necessarily! I have seen many students with full federal tuition support due poorly. The distractions and challenges, outside the classroom, still distract them. Plus it is not their money.

"Anne, I believe this discussion is wrongly focused. A university that does not offer study in major languages,classics, or theater is in a sorry state.

As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere.

"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

"Teaching is different from the usual at-will jobs because of the political element. In the absence of job protection, it is easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, etc.",stability,FAVOR,0,invalid,stability,"the document highlights how teaching is different from typical at-will jobs due to the political element involved. without job protection, teachers may face dismissal for various reasons such as teaching evolution, not teaching creationism, or engaging in political activities outside of school. this lack of stability in their employment puts teachers at risk for termination based on political reasons, which is not typical in other professions where at-will employment is common.

expansion:
the document explains that the teaching profession has a unique political aspect, unlike regular at-will jobs. in the absence of job protection, it is conceivable that teachers could lose their jobs for teaching evolution, refusing to teach creationism, or participating in political activities beyond the school grounds. this demonstrates that the stability of employment for teachers is jeopardized by political influences, which sets it apart from other occupations with at-will employment."

"I am a physics professor at a liber I was tenured as a physics professor at a private liberal arts university about 30 years ago. Over the course of the last 15 years, new hires in physics ( and mathematics too) have been in applied, multidisciplinary fields. Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire.

"So the plan is simply to hand an 85-year old senior citizen a cash payment and put the onus on them to decide if a procedure or test their doctor tells them they need is a good idea or not; when they're short on food and rent, and are trying to save money. If the goal is to reign in healthcare costs, it seems to be a far better idea to use the negotiating power of the government (and ACOs, Accountable Care Organizations) to hold healthcare providers accountable for ineffective and unnecessary testing and procedures. What I find most objectionable about the more conservative plans on this forum is that even though they frame their solutions as being mainly about reducing government waste, it really seems to always be about protecting the big monied interests or the super wealthy from ever taking a hit.

Yes, an arbitrarily fired teacher without tenure can sue, and might possibly collect... IF he or she can afford a lawyer, and IF he or she can make it through years of litigation without a job. Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so. It's stupidly simple: tenure is basically a law that says teachers, after several years of service, need to be informed of the reason they're being fired and given a chance to respond to those accusations.

"The Times editorial board confuses political and legal issues in its criticism of Justice Ginsburg. The Supreme Court does not decide political issues. It has based many refusals to consider such issues on its determination that they are political in nature. There is, therefore, no breach of legal ethics when a Justice voices an opinion on a matter of politics. Nothing is more political in nature than the fitness of a candidate to be president, and accordingly, Justice Ginsburg was both within her First Amendment rights as a citizen and the principles of judicial ethics to express her opinion.",judge speaking politically,FAVOR,0,invalid,judges speaking politically,"the document argues that the supreme court does not decide political issues and has refused to consider such issues as they are deemed political in nature. therefore, it is not a breach of legal ethics for a justice to voice an opinion on a political matter. justice ginsburg was within her first amendment rights as a citizen and the principles of judicial ethics to express her opinion on the fitness of a candidate to be president.

"Russia having a common interest in cooperating on terror seems like a valid point. But a minor one, when compared with Russia's larger geopolitical objectives.

By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere.

Even though we know that justices have political considerations and that is usually what gets them considered or nominated to the Court in the first place.

Moreover, you have to ask how great the crisis has to be for a member of the Court, who knows about keeping silence, to speak out. Remember Joe McCarthy, Professor?

"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms. It is a reality, not merely a sign of increasingly philistine times.",study humanity,FAVOR,0,invalid,study of humanities,"the document discusses the utilitarian justification for studying humanities, which is a common topic in many pieces and blogs. the author believes that critical thinking skills can also be obtained in the social and natural sciences, and the general skills provided by humanities are not necessarily unique. however, the author argues that the study of humanities offers valuable insight into human thinking and accomplishment throughout history, which is sufficient justification in itself. they also suggest involving scientists in the debate to make it more interdisciplinary. the document also acknowledges the increasing cost of university education, which has led many to think in narrowly pragmatic terms. the author sees this as a reflection of the reality of rising education costs, rather than a sign of increasingly philistine times.

"Dr. DuPont and the three other debaters conveniently overlook an important part of the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse: we really know very little about it. As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential.

Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France.

"Having a viewpoint on a person's candidacy is not necessarily a problem. if a case arises out of the election, she is expected to set those opinions aside to evaluate the law and facts. Justices Scalia and Thomas famously had direct and close ties to the Bush campaign. They deemed the ties to not be problematic in Bush v. Gore. Did anyone really wonder if those Justices supported Bush or Gore (or McCain, or Romney...)? In matters other than elections, Justices certainly and routinely have opinions on matters before a case arises before the court -- for example, many of the justices have written memos or articles or even represented clients on subjects such as affirmative action, or the requisite amount of deference to give an agency.",3d printing,NONE,0,invalid,elections,"the document explains that it is not a problem for a person, such as a justice, to have their own opinions and viewpoints on a candidate's candidacy. however, when a case arises, they are expected to set aside their opinions and evaluate the law and facts objectively. it references justices scalia and thomas, who had close ties to the bush campaign but did not see it as problematic in the bush v. gore case. it also mentions that justices often have opinions on matters before a case arises, such as writing memos or articles on topics like affirmative action or deference to give an agency.

Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school.

"The scarcity argument is so tiresome. We remain the wealthiest country in the world. There is no scarcity of funds; there's a lack of willingness to spend those funds on things like education. The elephant in the room here is college sports programs. (I can't believe none of the contributors to this debate even mentioned it!)

As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere.

"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

Nuclear energy only provides 8% of U.S. energy. We could easily conserve 8% and then begin the decommissioning of every nuclear power plant. Then we could take the BILLIONS and BILLIONS of dollars thrown at the nuclear industry and invest it in Renewable Energies like Wind and Solar Energy. Germany is HUGELY successful with Wind and Solar Energy. Germany has produced the energy-equivalent of 20 nuclear power plants (yes 20!!) with Solar Energy alone! They are having the same success with Wind Energy. This success in Renewable Energy proves how obsolete and unnecessary nuclear energy is.,rock roll,NONE,0,invalid,nuclear power,"the document argues that nuclear energy only provides 8% of u.s. energy and suggests that it could easily be conserved and then decommissioned. the writer proposes investing the billions of dollars spent on the nuclear industry into renewable energies like wind and solar energy. they point to germany as a successful example, stating that the country has produced the energy-equivalent of 20 nuclear power plants with solar energy alone and is having similar success with wind energy. the document concludes that the success of renewable energy proves that nuclear energy is obsolete and unnecessary.

when it comes to youth drug use, the document suggests that with longer life expectancy and fewer childhood deaths, there is less urgency for young people to engage in risky behaviors, such as drug use, in order to pass on their genes and ensure survival. this indicates that as society has progressed, there has been a shift away from the need for early reproduction and a focus on more educated and informed decision making.

"Obese people live difficult lives to be sure, but pointing the finger at genetics or saying they are discriminated against is simply avoiding the ugly truth. They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors.

Think of Joseph and the seven lean years that followed the fat years. As Steinberg points out, a firm that is a nonprofit or not-for-profit cannot distribute the profit to shareholders.

"I see a trend here.

"Conservative Christians and evangelicals have not historically condemned divorce the way that the Bible does, but they certainly have condemned homosexuality, the way the Bible doesn't. I might respect conservative Christians for their consistency if they refused to do business with divorced people, the way they want to refuse gay patrons. But conservative Christians -- like Wheaton College -- employ divorced people, serve divorced people, and welcome divorced people into communion without blinking. Their constant refrain is that they ""hate the sin, but love the sinner."" Now I'm not proposing we abolish divorce, but I do wish evangelicals would just NOTICE that sin, if they're so determined to purify our society. But, in fact, they treat divorced people very differently from gay people, and they're not even aware of their hypocrisy. If they could accept gay congregants the way they accept divorced congregants, the world would notice that the evangelical church is no longer self-righteous and judgemental and, frankly, angry.

However, college and life cost money, and employers are rarely as impressed with a philosophy degree and excellent command of Latin as with an economics degree and proficient Mandarin. Times change and so must education, unless any of the commentators would like to help unemployed classics majors repay their student loans.",gun,NONE,0,invalid,humanities programs,"the document suggests that it can be difficult for recent graduates with degrees in fields like philosophy or classics to find employment. employers often prioritize degrees in fields like economics and skills like mandarin proficiency over humanities degrees. the author implies that the education system needs to adapt to the changing job market, and suggests that commentators who disagree should help unemployed classics majors repay their student loans. #unemployed #classicsmajor #studentloans"
