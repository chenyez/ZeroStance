My advice to you is to limit your exposure to Fox News, quit watching reruns of 24 and Homeland, and think about what Jesus would do.

"Mr. Lat was kind enough to endorse individual lawsuits (by unpaid interns who likely have few resources for such a lawsuit) for the most egregious situations. So, basically, returning the U.S. to Dickensian England would be a good thing and the employment practices of that era should be celebrated. Mr. Lat, I hear there are some great openings for exceptionally skilled legal analysts in labor law at Foxconn - you ought to check them out.",unpaid intenship,AGAINST,1,invalid,unpaid intenship,"this document discusses mr. lat's endorsement of individual lawsuits for unpaid interns who often have limited resources to take legal action. the document sarcastically suggests that this endorsement is promoting a return to outdated and exploitative employment practices from dickensian england. it also makes a snarky remark about mr. lat potentially finding a job at foxconn, a company known for its controversial labor practices. the document implies displeasure with the lack of support for unpaid interns in the workforce."
What Chris Jacobs is really saying is that he hates a plan that the Heritage Foundation developed that was the basis of much of first Romenycare and Obamacare. I agree that there was a much simpler and better plan out there and I am a beneficiary of it and can tell you that it works real well for our family It's called Medicare and it will can serve us well as a common sense model for our entire population.,obamacare,AGAINST,1,invalid,obamacare,"chris jacobs is expressing his disdain for a plan developed by the heritage foundation that served as the basis for both romenycare and obamacare. the author agrees with jacobs and advocates for a simpler and more effective plan, which they believe is medicare. they state that they are a beneficiary of medicare and can attest to its effectiveness for their family. they suggest that medicare could be a common-sense model for the entire population. in other words, the author is in favor of medicare as a replacement for obamacare. #obamacare #heritagefoundation #romenycare #medicare"
"The writers do not get at the heart of the problem but the commenters do. The writers are interested in peripheral issues that are important to them. Gender bias may seem central, for example, but it isn't here: it's perhaps more important than this issue, but it's not the same as this issue. The problem the commenters see, rightly, is that students aren't qualified to evaluate teachers, and are biased by their narrow, anti-intellectual concerns.",rate professor,AGAINST,0,invalid,rate professors,"the document suggests that the writers on 'rate professor' do not address the main problem, but the commenters do. the writers focus on peripheral issues that are important to them, while the commenters see the real issue - that students are not qualified to evaluate teachers and are biased by their narrow, anti-intellectual concerns. the document also points out that gender bias, while important, is not the central issue in this context.  in conclusion, according to the document, the commenters on 'rate professor' are more insightful and focused on the real issues, compared to the writers."

At first the need for one person's opinion seemed unnecessary to me when we get so many for no cost but having critics is still very important in our lives; in the lives of the artist. To just the viewer it might not be so important for a professional critique but for the people behind the show it means a lot. Even if the critique isn't the most positive thing the artist still needs someone with experience to call them out on the things they might have not seen for themselves. Not just people that have time to post up ignorant comments.,professional critic,FAVOR,0,invalid,professional critics,"the document emphasizes the importance of having professional critics in the lives of artists. while it may seem unnecessary to some, professional critique is crucial for the people behind the show to improve and grow. even if the feedback is not entirely positive, it is essential for the artist to have someone with experience to point out things they may not have seen for themselves. this is especially important in contrast to ignorant comments from individuals who may not have the expertise or knowledge to provide valuable feedback. #professionalcritic #artistfeedback"

"You've got it all wrong. I am reminded of the prophetic commercial for Xerox ""on demand"" copiers; of course the commercial had everything to do with THIS and little with the product.

Then a smarty pants student stands up, tells everyone about the Xerox system (whereby one could theoretically print just a single book) and tells the class ""Now, EVERYONE can be a published author!""

When I was very young I would salt and pepper my morning cantaloupe. One of my younger sisters friends would sprinkle sugar on cottage cheese. We have since grown up and I suspect neither of us does this any more.

"Its not about religion, its about self-destructive behavior and child abuse. We 'believe' that more available birth control and education are at odds with mainstream religion; when actually most of the devote are not fanatics. America is afraid to place restriction on the poor, mentally retarded, mentally ill, felons, or even youth to prevent them from having children or owning guns. To do so places a society at risk of sterilizing the innocent, or worse. I've watched so many members of my family seek religious solutions to medical issues because the medical answers aren't there. They become recluses in homeless shelters. They suffer and their children suffer. Society somehow imagines the answer is making them 'unborn' because real solutions are complex, expensive and require new technologies that aren't here yet.

People are being shot in circumstances in which a cop of a generation ago never would have unholstered his weapon.

Whites are losing dominace and this is a rising period of backlash and control. The personal is political. Yes this was a personal murder.

NB, physics has the advantage that grades are based on scores, not potentially subjective measures, hence it was not the case that students' grades were influenced by the instructor's impression of them.

"Having worked in the public library sector in Australia for over 20 years, I am a strong advocate of life-long learning and equity in access to information, thus I support the Open Access movement. In May 2012 I started in a fixed-term contract position at a University Library, my first foray into academic librarianship. As such, the topic of digital libraries and institutional repositories is of personal interest to me. The Open Access movement and institutional repositories have openly challenged the traditional scholarly communication system, supporting a new model for scholarly communication. Indeed, it is possible for academic libraries to alleviate the conflict between these two paradigms. Institutional repositories (by their very nature) exert pressure on journal publishers to permit as much free online access to their content as economically possible. The library and information sector plays an important role in providing public access to networked information. Public libraries worldwide are a significant component; by ensuring that there is equity in access to information (for both educational and recreational purposes) through the provision of quality library services for all citizens.",library,FAVOR,1,invalid,libraries,"this document discusses the author's experience working in the public library sector in australia for over 20 years, and their advocacy for life-long learning and equity in access to information, as supported by the open access movement. they also mention their transition into academic librarianship and their personal interest in digital libraries and institutional repositories. the open access movement and institutional repositories are seen as challenging the traditional scholarly communication system, and it is suggested that academic libraries can play a role in alleviating the conflict between these two paradigms. institutional repositories are noted to put pressure on journal publishers to allow as much free online access to their content as possible. the document also emphasizes the important role of the library and information sector in providing public access to networked information, with public libraries playing a significant role in ensuring equity in access to information for all citizens.

Online, I don't come across things for which I am not searching. In a library, it is all there before me, waiting.

As the publishing industry transforms, not surprisingly the borrowing of physical books from libraries is likely to decline. However, the need for access to information is likely to grow.

the author then applies this analogy to the gene debate, indicating that they believe it is no different. they argue that if they were to assemble a new molecule that did not exist before, like the buckyball, they would own the rights to it. however, if they simply discovered the molecular structure of a gene, they should not be able to claim ownership of it.

I'm an attorney and frequently appear in Family Court. The court has substituted audio recording for live reporters in most proceedings. The resultant recordings are then transcribed manually by someone listening to the audio record if transcript is ordered. The transcripts that are typed from the audio recording of the proceeding are invariably terrible. Parts of the transcript are virtually always missed and marked as 'inaudible.'

"There are numerous reasons why Birthright Citizenship makes no sense and virtually no arguments in its favor other that ""it has been done that way"".

"A lot of these comments criticize the use of RMP because students who don't like to do work and want to be entertained tend to like the easier professors. This is too shallow a view of RMP. RMP has extremely valuable information because people actually type in information. When you read over and over that the teacher fails to adequately explain material so that everyone is confused at test time, that's important information for a student. When you read again and again that the teacher doesn't like taking questions and instead prefers to stick to her outline, that's important information. When you read numerous reviews saying the students came away from the class with a new love of the material, that's important information. It's also really easy to see which professors are well-liked for being easy--which is also important information for a student who either needs a filler class to round out an otherwise brutal semester, or needs stronger instruction in that subject, in which case he can avoid the easy teacher.

"I'm saddened that cursive is not considered important. Both my school-age boys (8th and 10th grade) have horribly illegible printing habits. They sometimes cannot read cursive. I'm more appalled to read here that SPELLING is not required in the Common Core standards! Are you serious? I'd noticed a lack of focus on spelling as my kids have gone through school, but I didn't realize that we nationally did not consider it an important skill. Spell-check isn't a good substitute, people! It is frequently wrong. And my kids seem to believe that if spell-check says something might be wrong, that it IS wrong - causing them to make more errors than they would have. (Besides, if spell-check is the reason spelling isn't crucial anymore, then why didn't we skip teaching spelling once dictionaries were invented?)

Mostly I feel the Times does a decent job moderating the comments, although I often notice the same pro-Hillary bias in many of the NYT picks as opposed to the Reader's Picks.

Often it is commenters who bring these up, and columnists never address them.

So the new role of a man is to inspire faith where there is fear, courage where there is doubt, hope in despair and love in the midst of hate. all this talk of rough edged muscles, sweatiness instead of perfume, ability to light fires and chop wood are nothing more than sexual fantasies and turn ons - which of course is still necessary for good relationships and survival of the species.",masculinity,NONE,1,invalid,masculinity,"the document discusses the traditional notion of masculinity, which originated in primal times when manhood was associated with the ability to ensure survival and provide for one's family and community. men were seen as warriors, hunters, frontiersmen, guards, and providers, while women were seen as homemakers. however, modern society is relatively safe and women are able to provide for themselves. despite this, modern threats have taken new forms, and the inner emotions of fear, insecurity, doubt, and hopelessness still exist. the new role of a man is to inspire faith, courage, hope, and love in the face of these challenges. the document also suggests that traditional ideas about masculinity, such as ruggedness and physical strength, are often just sexual fantasies and turn-ons, which are still important for relationships but not necessary for survival.

"Mr. Kornbluth asserts that CIA agents are dedicated individuals whose only goal is to serve and defend the country. That statement is as empty as a whiskey barrel at an Appalachian stomp festival. How does one serve the country? Do you serve the country by violating its fundamental principles with torture, even if it yields, which it didn't, helpful information? Are you defending the country by inciting terrorist groups who use your crimes as recruiting tools? The CIA missed the collapse of the Soviet Union. It missed the 9/11 attack; it led us into a war with Iraq by supporting false intelligence; it missed the upheavals in Egypt, Libya and Syria. In the end, it is probably true that the CIA has the interests of the country as their objective. The question is: How do they define those interests? It seems very clear their definition is consistent with the Barry Goldwater/ Neocons/Dick Cheney dictum: Excess in defense of liberty is no vice. And this, of course, profoundly and utterly misses the point.",c.i.a,AGAINST,0,invalid,the c.i.a.,"in the document, the author criticizes the claim that cia agents are dedicated individuals whose sole purpose is to serve and defend the country. they argue that this statement is meaningless and questions how one can truly serve the country. they point out that actions like torture and inciting terrorist groups only harm the country's fundamental principles and security. the document also highlights the failures of the cia, such as missing the collapse of the soviet union and the 9/11 attack, as well as supporting false intelligence in the iraq war and missing upheavals in other countries. the author suggests that the cia's definition of the country's interests aligns with a belief in excessive defense of liberty, which they believe misses the true purpose of defending the nation. the cia stands for the central intelligence agency, and the author references barry goldwater, neocons, and dick cheney, who are all political figures."

"William Donovan-head of the OSS during WWII, which was the predecessor to the CIA, had doubts about continuing the agency in peacetime. he was right. one of the problems with the CIA's covert activities is that they are usually only covert to the American people. those on the receiving end of these activities know perfectly well what is going on. the American people had no idea that the CIA was overthrowing the elected govt of iran in 1953, but the Iranians knew it. when there is blowback the American public's reaction is-why do they hate us. we didn't do anything to them",c.i.a,AGAINST,0,invalid,the c.i.a.,"the document discusses how william donovan, who was the head of the office of strategic services (oss) during world war ii, had concerns about continuing the agency in peacetime. the oss was the predecessor to the central intelligence agency (cia). the document suggests that donovan's doubts were justified, as one of the problems with the cia's covert activities is that they are usually only covert to the american people. those on the receiving end of these activities are often aware of what is going on.

the document also mentions that the american people were unaware of the cia's involvement in overthrowing the elected government of iran in 1953, while the iranians were well aware of it. it suggests that this lack of transparency can lead to blowback, and that the american public's reaction to blowback is often confusion, such as asking ""why do they hate us?"" and claiming ""we didn't do anything to them.""

"Thank you, Mr Johnson. I would remind people that ""New Does Not Equal Better."" People often make the mistake of assuming everything that is new is better. In fact, we can think of many new things that are worse at the deepest levels on out souls: chain stores, etc. And late 19th Century architecture, for example of the Belle Epoque, is unspeakably superior to architecture put out by the reprehensible ""starchitects"" of today. And one need only look to the universally hopeless and laughable car designs of the 21st Century to realize that cars of the 1960s and 1950s, designed by our ""uncool"" fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers, were far superior and ""cooler"" than those designed by people today who think they are so cool. There is a movement in this civilization towards degradation of the soul, propagated by the 21st Century American corporation, which has been described as having emptiness and degradation at its heart.

There are certainly areas of deep poverty in rural areas, but why single these areas out for special treatment? Furthermore, I wonder if ""genuine opportunity"" will ever exist in many sparsely populated areas. What sorts of opportunity would you recommend? Cities exist for a reason; they allow people to gather so that commerce can occur.

The Obama administration frittered away its time endlessly debating and proposing plans designed by Republicans in order to bring Republicans to the table. Predictably, they took up his offer to dither but refused to ultimately offer a single affirmative vote even though the plan is the Heritage Foundation's alternative to Hillary Clinton's proposal from the '90's. What Obama should have done is taken Medicare for All, jammed it through without dithering with an obstinate and mendacious bunch of saboteurs, and relished the political victory of delivering a wildly popular program. Instead, he dithered and ended up with a program that no one is willing to brag about.",obamacare,AGAINST,1,invalid,obamacare,"the document criticizes the obama administration for their handling of the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. the writer argues that the administration made a mistake by trying to compromise and work with republicans, who ultimately did not support the bill. instead, they suggest that obama should have pushed for a single-payer healthcare system and not wasted time trying to please republicans. the writer believes that by doing so, obama could have achieved a popular and successful healthcare program. the obama administration is blamed for ignoring warnings and not taking a more aggressive approach to the healthcare reform. the document also uses slang like ""dithering"" and ""mendacious bunch of saboteurs"" to describe the administration's actions. it also refers to obamacare as the ""wildly popular program"" that the writer believes it could have been."

"The author, in her zeal to protect the insurance companies from public wrath, has just made a splendid argument for Medicare for All. The Obama administration, naive in the extreme, though it had bought the support of Mark Bertolini and the other captains of the health insurance industry, when it had only rented them for a limited time. Now Mr. Bertolini, having failed in his effort to extort from the Justice Department a decision not to do its duty and raise anti-trust objections to AETNA's effort to create, through merger, a non-competitive insurance market, has taken his revenge on the American people. In view of the number of mergers sought and suspiciously similar requests for increases in ACA health care costs, perhaps the Justice Department should initiate an investigation of price fixing and collusion among health insurance companies.

"The status quo ante prior to Obamacare was that healthcare was a complete perversion of the free market and open competition. This country allowed insurance companies to corner the market on healthcare via insurance, to price medical treatment beyond the range of any individual to pay without insurance, and therefore to deny care and coverage to anyone with impunity. Obama has restored the balance by taking away the insurance companies' ability to block consumers from receiving medical care. He did it without the social violence that, by rights, should have accompanied such a revolutionary change. Obama actually initiated a return of healthcare to a free market, competitive status. But it required an acknowledgement that basic healthcare is a right that cannot be abridged.",obamacare,FAVOR,1,invalid,obamacare,"the document argues that before the affordable care act (obamacare), the healthcare system in the united states was a distortion of the free market and open competition. insurance companies had a monopoly on healthcare, setting high prices that made medical treatment unaffordable for many people without insurance. as a result, they could deny care and coverage to individuals without consequences. according to the document, obama addressed this imbalance by preventing insurance companies from blocking consumers from accessing medical care. this change, it states, was revolutionary but was implemented without social unrest. the document contends that obama's actions have helped to bring healthcare back to a fair and competitive market. it also argues that obama's reforms acknowledge that basic healthcare is a right that cannot be infringed upon.

"No one knows whether a ""real-looking"" name on a comment is authentic, nor do they agree on even what makes a name ""real-looking"". Furthermore, there is actually very little agreement on whether an idea is offensive merely because of the way it is expressed, or whether certain ideas should be considered so offensive that they may never be expressed in even the most cultivated verbiage. The writer's premise that anonymity produces bad ideas and vulgar expression appears highly doubtful. I submit that the quality of the idea being discussed is the only thing that matters, and that there will never be a consensus on that evaluation. If quality is too low (as in the bulk of what appears on Twitter), individuals are free to consider the idea poor or the manner of expression deficient.

"Comments are a useful and frequently informative part of online news; they should be encouraged but much more closely monitored. For openers, commenters should be allowed only one comment per article to avoid these ubiquitous back and forth , witless arguments which often clog the comments section. Obscene, vulgar and personal attacks should be edited out, but care must be exercised. Many subjects almost demand strong comments which some may find offensive, but do not really cross the line. Some are clearly at the far left, right, or some other extreme, but often bring out ignored, but important points of view. In addition, many articles and editorials contain claims that are either wrong or at best distorted, despite usually high standards of editorial review.

"In our community, the most elegant, welcoming and practical buildings are our libraries. In the 9 years I have lived here, two libraries have been built and one redesigned and refurbished.

I don't think the drug reform or criminal justice reform movements would be where they are right now if not for the power of online comments.

That's one of the things that got us into mass incarceration in the first place. A big reason why we are moving out of that period now is because various people outside the media elite who have their facts together on drug and criminal justice reform were able to use comments sections to communicate arguments about race and drug enforcement and criminal justice policy that the media status quo wasn't ready to play in prime time.

"This is from the study that this writer Christie Wilcox cited about Organic farms being less ""efficient."" ""We found crop yields to be 20% lower in the organic systems, although input of fertilizer and energy was reduced by 34 to 53% and pesticide input by 97%. Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs."" With the reduction in energy and pesticides they seem pretty efficient to me. All organic practices are not equal. Organic systems that ""stack"" crops like growing mushrooms beneath orchards or ducks and fish being raised along side rice patties are way more ""efficient"" than conventional. Science does prove organics are healthier and safer.

Because those professors challenge students to push past their comfort zones and rigid patterns of thinking.

Another poster on here mentioned volunteer workers who put in long hours while the heads of those charities reap huge salaries and benefits.

Similarly, the percentage of adolescents aged 12-19 years who were obese increased from 5% to nearly 21% over the same period. Now, more than one-third of American children and adolescents are overweight or obese.

"We need an agency like the CIA. If splitting it gives carte blanche to one to group to carry out black ops without oversight, no! More likely, we need to split the Dept. Of Homeland Security, a grotesque organization in which singular organizations like the Secret Service lost their focus. Even more likely, we need a national ethos that dictates the limits of operations by the hard men and ethically challenged who are attracted to violence and torture. How often do we need to say it?

"One of the useful roles a comment sections can serve: an immediate correction mechanism from the general public when an author is demonstrably wrong on the facts. For example, another news site ran an article decrying the fact that none of the presidential candidates had bothered to pay any attention to New York's public housing projects. Within about 15 minutes of the story being released, commenters were putting up links to stories about Bernie Sanders visiting New York's public housing projects about 10 hours earlier, a rebuttal that many readers might have been unaware of had the comment section not existed. And the New York Times' centralized moderation system isn't the only way to get real legitimate debate going, with evidence and logic being thrown around (along with the occasional entertainment like parody song lyrics or poetry).",comment section,FAVOR,1,invalid,comment sections,"the document highlights the importance of comment sections as a tool for the general public to immediately correct factual errors made by authors. it gives an example of a news article falsely claiming that none of the presidential candidates had paid attention to new york's public housing projects, and how commenters quickly responded with evidence of bernie sanders visiting the projects. this demonstrates how comment sections can provide a platform for legitimate debate, evidence, and logic to be shared, as well as entertaining content like parody song lyrics or poetry.

"The CIA reminds me by its recent actions of the old joke, ""Military Intelligence is a contradiction in terms.""

Since the actuarial value is increasing from 45% today to 80% (% of premiums paid in claims) in the individual market, its going to be a better deal by definition. Mr. Roy forgot to mention that.

Back in the day I recall getting my midterm and paper back while taking the final. The prof did not give me my paper during the exam because I had done poorly and he did not want me to lose my concentration. Nice guy. When I finally got the paper from him and he told me how bad it was I had to hold my tongue because he could still have failed me. Of course if I had known I was doing poorly in the class I would have gone to his office and asked him how I could improve. Ask what I was doing wrong.

"Today's hyper-enhanced CGI extravaganzas are not movies, they are video games, where the effects themselves are the featured attraction. It is sensory overload-----pacing, story, character development take a back seat to this new aesthetic.

One even imagines that it is the CGI that comes first------waking up in the middle of the night with an 'Oh, wow, that would be AWESOME!' kind of idea, they then build a movie around it only afterward. It is a new language, a new vernacular, of the filmmakers art. Whether anyone but the youngest speak this tongue is a moot point. As the saying goes, if you have to ask, you can't afford it.

I have found it preferable to hire graduates or students who are committed to working for more than a semester at a low wage with the understanding that due to their lack of experience, I will teach them, but they are more committed to stick around once they have learned and make great employees as their salaries go up with their abilities.",salt diet,NONE,0,invalid,unpaid intenship,"the document expresses a dislike for using unpaid interns, citing it as a form of elitism because only students from wealthy families can afford to work for free. the author believes that students who have to work to support themselves while in school make the best employees, as they take learning and work seriously. graduates today are entering the workforce with fewer skills and job experience compared to previous generations. the document's author prefers to hire graduates or students who are committed to working for a low wage for an extended period, and believes that they make great employees as their abilities and salaries increase over time.

"In the Canadian legal system - and I suspect the American one is the same - a reasonable apprehension of bias is considered to be as pernicious as an actual bias. Indeed, the test has always been whether a party can establish the former, and not the latter. While few are so naive as to think that justices have no views, it is incomprehensible to me that a justice would enter the fray this way. It is unhelpful generally, and it is detrimental to the Court. It is unhelpful in that I doubt those who lean toward Mr. Trump place much weight on Judge Ginsburg's views to begin with - so she is unlikely to change anyone's mind (especially considering the widely-held anti-elites sentiment that has become so prominent this year). And it is detrimental to a Court that has struggled so much in recent years to combat the view that the Court is every bit as entrenched and political as the rest of the political system is.

"Stock's argument confuses me. It likely confuses her too. I favor population control everywhere. England does not need the Moslems of the East nor does France or Germany. This statement of mine should not be read as prejudice towards the MOSLEMS OF Europe. It is meant to say that if the Moslem states cannot run their business in a way that its people enjoy a reasonable standard of living for all its people it is no one else's responsibility to pick up the slack. The only exception to this broad principle might be war refugees. But people who come to the USA to deliver a child so that it can enjoy the fruits of citizenship , should not enjoy this privilege. That child is the result of two participants only one of whom resides in any sense of the word in the USA",parent home schoolers paying school funded extra curricular,NONE,0,invalid,birthright citizenship,"the author is expressing confusion over stocks' argument, and believes that it likely confuses others as well. they express a favor for population control worldwide, stating that england, france, and germany do not need the muslims of the east. the author clarifies that this is not meant to be prejudice towards muslims in europe, but rather a statement that if muslim states cannot provide a reasonable standard of living for their people, it is not the responsibility of other countries to make up for it. they make an exception for war refugees, but believe that people who come to the usa to have a child solely for the purpose of giving them citizenship should not be granted that privilege. they also believe that only one of the child's parents should reside in the usa. 
with respect to 'parent home schoolers paying school funded extra curricular', the author appears to be arguing that parents who choose to homeschool their children should not have to pay for school-funded extracurricular activities.

At this stage of the game of the perpetuation of fundamentally flawed economic system Greece will be cutting its own throat to abandon the Euro.

"I was home-schooled, and so I sympathize with the plight of home-schoolers without adequate athletic competition. However there are at least two strong arguments against home-schoolers' inclusion (and against the tax payer argument) that none of the debaters brought up: 1) Private school families also pay taxes and yet may not try out for public school teams 2) Public schools only get funds based upon enrollment. Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken? I suppose the only reason it's even considered is the opportunity for competitive advantage to the school. If they were demanding inclusion in art class, I doubt it would be on the table.",amazon,NONE,1,invalid,home-schoolers,"the document brings up two strong arguments against including home-schoolers in athletic competition: 1) private school families also pay taxes and may not try out for public school teams, and 2) public schools only receive funds based on enrollment, so opting out and then demanding services is unfair. the author questions why these points were not brought up in the debate. the author speculates that the only reason home-schoolers' inclusion is being considered is for the competitive advantage it can bring to the school. the author also suggests that if home-schoolers were demanding inclusion in art class, it likely wouldn't be on the table.

"With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff.

"The top two reasons cats are turned into shelters are house soiling and aggression (biting). It is a well-known fact that declawed cats are deprived of their main form of defense (claws), and resort to biting. Additionally, it is painful for many declawed cats to dig in a litter box. Hence, house soiling. Shelters I have volunteered at have quite a few declawed cats come in due to these reasons, declawing being the source of these issues. Pet owners who want to declaw a cat should not have a cat--period. If you want to protect your furniture, do not own a cat. Cats naturally scratch. If dog owners don't want their animal to jump on their couches or beds, do they remove a dog's leg? If dog owners don't want a dog to bark, is debarking humane?

"Totally agree with the writer. As a woman's hair is considered sexually arousing, by covering her hair, the woman is essentially taking on the responsibility that she is the CAUSE of a man's sexual thoughts and actions and she is the one who cause him to 'sin'. This eventually leads to the common perception that 'she asked for it'. For decades, women in the west has fought and is still fighting hard to dispel such perceptions.

Because those professors challenge students to push past their comfort zones and rigid patterns of thinking.

Rate my Professor is essentially an internet scam to generate site traffic. I am sorry to see it getting this kind of free publicity in a serious paper like the NYT. Rate my Professor is a for-profit site. You can even post a review of someone without ever having taken a class with that person or on a class that the professor never taught. Try it.

They ensure that only students who actually took the class participate in the evaluation process.,modern men,NONE,1,invalid,rate professors,"the document highlights the criticism of rate my professor, calling it an internet scam to boost site traffic. it expresses disappointment in seeing the platform gaining attention in a reputable newspaper like the new york times. the document points out that rate my professor is a for-profit website where users can post reviews without even taking a class with the professor or on a class the professor never taught. it encourages readers to try it themselves. the document also mentions that most universities have systems in place for faculty evaluations to ensure that only students who have taken the class can participate in the process. 

modern men should be cautious when using websites like rate my professor, as it may not provide accurate or reliable information. it's important for modern men to consider the source and legitimacy of online reviews and ratings to make informed decisions about professors and classes. they should also be aware of the evaluation systems in place at their universities to ensure the credibility of feedback on faculty members."

"The only solidarity the hijab shows is with that most ancient of patriarchal male control strategies, shifting the burden of morality, family and male honor, etc., onto the shoulders of female modesty. It is no different from Orthodox Jewish married women having to cover their hair, or the in the Middle Ages married women in Europe were expected to wear a coif to cover their hair, and is nakedly an attempt to confine women's sexual nature in as small a space as possible. It stands in relationship to footbinding and to female genital mutilation, albeit at another point on the bellcurve of control of women and control of female sexuality. If you insist on sacrificing yourself on this altar to show ethnic solidarity, don't be surprised when people conclude that Islam is still stuck in the past. As Rhett Butler once famously said to Scarlett in ""Gone with the Wind"" when she refused to abandon black mourning clothes for a husband she not only didn't love, but despised, ""How closely women clutch the chains that bind them!""

"One of the useful roles a comment sections can serve: an immediate correction mechanism from the general public when an author is demonstrably wrong on the facts. For example, another news site ran an article decrying the fact that none of the presidential candidates had bothered to pay any attention to New York's public housing projects. Within about 15 minutes of the story being released, commenters were putting up links to stories about Bernie Sanders visiting New York's public housing projects about 10 hours earlier, a rebuttal that many readers might have been unaware of had the comment section not existed. And the New York Times' centralized moderation system isn't the only way to get real legitimate debate going, with evidence and logic being thrown around (along with the occasional entertainment like parody song lyrics or poetry).",supermarket,NONE,0,invalid,comment sections,"the document discusses the usefulness of comment sections as mechanisms for immediate corrections from the general public. it provides an example of how commenters were able to quickly correct an author's factual error in an article about presidential candidates' attention to new york's public housing projects. this serves as evidence that comment sections can facilitate real debate and provide evidence and logic to support or refute claims made in an article. additionally, it highlights the value of comment sections in bringing attention to important information that may have been overlooked by the original author.
