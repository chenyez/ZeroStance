"Ginsburg's statement has no bearing on the separations of powers nor upon how she will consider cases under review, so I do not think what she said was improper. I do not think that Ginsberg did anything inappropriate since she did not in anyway refer to anything that will ever come before the Supreme Court. The Court has no ability to make any judgments that have any effect upon the election of Presidents nor of who is appointed to the Court. Such a personal opinion will never affect anything that is addressed by the Court. If anything, she is stating something which the mass media is ignoring because it's so caught up in the sport of elections to do any relevant analysis of the foreseeable consequences of who ends up as the next President.",I am in favor of supreme court control election outcome ! ,FAVOR
"The liberals' contributions to this section are basically saying that two Articles and four Amendments will fix what two Articles and three Amendments haven't. Yet, the states do a good job of running elections and the required IDs are easy to get, in a process already overseen by our heavily politicized DOJ. Regarding the extravagant demand for transportation, both major parties have local people who drive you to get IDs or to vote already. We should keep that effort in the private sector where it arose. If you are frantic enough not to trust the judicial system already, one more amendment won't cure what ails you. What would help all of us is more knowledge of history - which we won't find on the Soros blogs. Force people to vote? When all they are interested in is celebrity and sports buzz or their iPhones, absolutely not. They'll end up simply voting for the first name, and when that is a GOPer, we'll have to keep watch over the bridges in the big-city liberal-statist philosophical ghettos/campuses.",I am in favor of constitutional right ! ,FAVOR

"Christians appropriated the ""Old Testament"" aka the Jewish Scriptures as a prefiguration of the Greek ""New Testament.""

If Jesus said something contrary to that, like love thy neighbor, well, Jesus obviously meant ""except those you find reasons in the OT to hate on."" The basis of this illegitimate reading of the Jewish Scriptures is the Gospel attributed to John, the latest of the Gospels and the one most evangelicals love above all other books. John's Gospel says Jesus was In the Beginning, so He must have meant to condemn S & G just like his angry Father.

Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours.

Then there is Los Angeles: we tore up the Red Car service in belief that freeways were the ultimate solution. They weren't.. Then folks fought against new rail systems for 20-30 years before we were finally able to embark on new systems that now enjoy high ridership levels and public approval. Light rail, commuter rail, heavy rail, high-speed rail: it doesn't seem to make a difference to a segment of our society that lays every possible obstacle in the way of passenger rail, obstacles that magically disappear when one considers highways. Makes one wonder.",I am in favor of speed rail ! ,FAVOR

"#12 elizabeth: Right on about the continued importance of French! French is spoken as a native or near-native language by something like 200 million people (most of whom are not French). If you add a few hundred million more non-native speakers and consider the global distribution of places where French is important to commerce and politics, it is obviously one of the most widely spoken and influential languages in the world - and the numbers are growing, not falling. French-speaking Africa is experiencing some of the highest rates of population growth in the world, and incidentally contains a large chunk of the world's untapped supplies of oil, uranium, and other natural resources. Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright. So yes, French is a heavy hitter as global languages go. In some parts of the world, it is indispensable for diplomacy and business.

The best American universities recognize that they are graduating multi-dimensional human beings. Nothing could be more destructive of our civilization than to graduate one-dimensional specialists. Today's political campaign, with its capture by extremist reactionaries of gullible voters undereducated for citizenship, demonstrates that we have an acute need for multi-dimensional education throughout our society.

As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere.

"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.",I am in favor of justice term limit ! ,FAVOR

"It's strange that Christians can read the Bible and not see how many times the concept of ""marriage"" has changed. Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah ""marry"" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife. Mosaic law allowed men to obtain divorces from their wives and remarry, but Jesus (who supposedly did not change one ""jot or tittle"" of the law) said that this was adultery in most cases. Clearly ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable. It seems an odd thing to hold ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" to be fixed and unalterable now when it was not so in the past, and it is needlessly cruel to use this concept as a means of hurting loving, committed same-sex couples.",I am in favor of relationship changeable ! ,FAVOR

Over the course of the last 15 years, new hires in physics ( and mathematics too) have been in applied, multidisciplinary fields. Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire.

The people who rent cycles to tourists don't bother telling them they aren't allowed to ride on the sidewalks or the footpaths in central Park.

"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms.

"No one can ever truly afford to have a child. Mankind would have died out eons ago if we'd all waited. But then we lived VERY modestly on one income so we had no child care expenses. Anyone who graduates from college with 6 figure student loans is a fool - there are ways to get a college education without doing that. I agree that those with only a high school diploma absolutely must delay children until they achieve some financial stability - if they don't, they'll have a lifetime of poverty. But all these college-educated young who are delaying parenthood until their forties so they can obtain all the material things they desire and take all the trips are only fooling themselves.

"Christians appropriated the ""Old Testament"" aka the Jewish Scriptures as a prefiguration of the Greek ""New Testament."" So anything in the OT that they found handy, like God raining down destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, they tout incessantly. If Jesus said something contrary to that, like love thy neighbor, well, Jesus obviously meant ""except those you find reasons in the OT to hate on."" The basis of this illegitimate reading of the Jewish Scriptures is the Gospel attributed to John, the latest of the Gospels and the one most evangelicals love above all other books. John's Gospel says Jesus was In the Beginning, so He must have meant to condemn S & G just like his angry Father. For Dreher to say, as another commenter pointed out, that Christians have a right to base national policy and law on their own religious beliefs, is to assert the primacy of their personal beliefs over the beliefs and rights of others. That's the model of theocracy. Ironically, the same people who loudly protest against ""Sharia law"" would gladly impose ""Christian law"" on the nation.

It is fairly obvious that their is a certain limit to which resources would be strained. But the focus is totally off. Poverty causes population growth, not the other way around.

"#12 elizabeth: Right on about the continued importance of French! French is spoken as a native or near-native language by something like 200 million people (most of whom are not French). If you add a few hundred million more non-native speakers and consider the global distribution of places where French is important to commerce and politics, it is obviously one of the most widely spoken and influential languages in the world - and the numbers are growing, not falling. French-speaking Africa is experiencing some of the highest rates of population growth in the world, and incidentally contains a large chunk of the world's untapped supplies of oil, uranium, and other natural resources. Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright. So yes, French is a heavy hitter as global languages go. In some parts of the world, it is indispensable for diplomacy and business.

"This write up is enlightening and sensible, dispeling some popular misconception about the breath taking 3D printing technological revolution. Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster.

For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided.

French is not a very useful language in the US, unless you plan on working abroad or in Canada. I don't condone removing languages entirely from education (learning any language is a useful skill), but in order to make the most of a person's time and his/her desire to learn a certain language, then offer what has the highest demand, probably these days Spanish and Mandarin, the two most spoken languages globally ahead of English.

The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years.

"The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San José is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life.

De facto the undocumented become documented regardless of whether they followed the official rules or ignored them, and both are effectively officially entitled to act however they have been. Effectively the IDs would make people into legitimate residents and workers, making visas and work permits meaningless obstacles to anyone who wishes to live and to work here.

However, because of the new bike lanes, I now feel safe enough to bike around my neighborhood in Brooklyn. This summer, I bought a bike for the first time. Yesterday -- December 21 -- I biked 13 miles to visit my parents in Manhattan, riding 75% of the way on bike lanes. The assertions that (a) the bike lanes don't help move people from cars and public transit to bikes, (b) bikers stop using the lanes in the colder months, and (c) bikers prefer non-bike-laned streets are all false in my case.

By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere.
