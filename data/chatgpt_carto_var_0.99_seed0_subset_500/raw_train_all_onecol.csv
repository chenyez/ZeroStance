"Despite numerous international treaties attempting to limit or eliminate nuclear weapons, the reality on the ground suggests otherwise. One such example is North Korea, who has consistently disregarded these treaties and continued to develop their nuclear arsenal. And while the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) has been adopted by most countries, some countries like India, Pakistan, and North Korea, have not ratified it. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of disarmament efforts, but even major powers like the US and Russia have been unable to comprehensively eliminate their nuclear weapons.
Additionally, some countries have used their membership in these treaties as a cover for nuclear weapons development. For instance, Iran, which signed on to the NPT in 1970, still managed to secretly develop its nuclear program, despite being a member of the treaty. Furthermore, the lack of transparency regarding the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons by various countries raises the question of whether these treaties are being enforced properly.",International treaties on nuclear weapons are ineffective.,FAVOR,2,FAVOR

"One argument against veganism as a sustainable solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is that it does not take into account the entire supply chain. For example, most vegan protein sources such as soy and legumes are grown in monoculture, which requires massive amounts of soil tilling, fertilizers, and pesticides that generate additional greenhouse emissions. Additionally, veganism often relies heavily on imported foods, which involves long industrial journeys spanning several continents and further contributes to carbon emissions. Another point to consider is that the popularity of veganism is causing pressure on the food industry to replace animal proteins with highly processed, plant-based alternatives that contain non-nutritive additives.

"According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana has been proven to have medicinal benefits for individuals with various illnesses. Legalizing the drug for recreational use would allow people to access these benefits without fear of prosecution. Additionally, legalization would create a new source of tax revenue for states and reduce the burden of funding law enforcement efforts related to marijuana enforcement. It would also release resources that could be redirected to more pressing issues, such as combatting the opioid epidemic and other public health concerns. Long term, legalizing marijuana would result in economic growth and job creation in the industrial sector, similar to what we saw with the end of alcohol prohibition in the 1930s. Furthermore, legalization would eliminate the current black market for marijuana and reduce criminal activity related to the drug trade. As we have seen in states like Colorado and California, the regulation of marijuana has not led to an uptick in crime or drug abuse. In fact, legalizing marijuana has resulted in a decrease in overall drug use and drug-related crimes.", Marijuana should be legalized for recreational use nationwide.,FAVOR,2,FAVOR

This sentencing disparity has a disproportionately negative impact on the African-American community, which is yet to be rectified.

Furthermore, studies indicate that sentencing disparities are more prevalent when judicial discretion is involved. In one instance, two individuals who were caught with the same amount of cocaine - one crack, the other powder - received vastly different sentences. The African-American defendant was sentenced to 20 years in prison, while the white defendant received only 3 years’ probation.

To compare a woman's right to choose with the taking of a human life is an egregious error in moral judgment. Pro-choice advocates also make the argument that abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest, but this falls prey to the faulty logic of punishing the innocent.

"Data collection is an integral part of the modern business landscape. With the rise of big data and machine learning, companies can gain valuable insights by analyzing user behavior. However, this process often requires collecting and storing personal data. For instance, companies such as Spotify collect individual user data such as their listening history and search queries to enhance user experience and personalize the platform. These insights lean towards improving the customer experience rather than exploiting it, which is favorable for both the user and the business.

Similarly, companies such as Amazon use browsing activity and purchase history to provide targeted advertisements and relevant product recommendations that enhance the user experience. Without collecting such data, the experience would be generic and less appealing to the user, leading to a loss of engagement, and ultimately, a lost customer. Moreover, collecting personal data is essential for detecting fraudulent activities, scams, and identity theft. Companies can identify out-of-the-ordinary account activities and safeguard users' information, providing a secure environment.

Therefore, companies should not be required to obtain user consent before collecting any personal information.

"Many individuals have found success and independence through the gig economy. One example is a freelance graphic designer who can choose their clients and schedule, making it easier to balance work and personal life. Another is a task-based platform that allows individuals to make money by completing simple tasks for businesses. This offers a flexible source of income for those with busy schedules or other financial constraints.

Another positive aspect of the gig economy is its ability to provide opportunities for those who may not have been able to enter the traditional workforce due to barriers such as age or disability. By eliminating the need for a physical workplace or strict schedule, individuals can work from home or complete tasks on their own time. This allows them to create a consistent income stream while still fulfilling their other obligations.

Furthermore, the gig economy can provide an opportunity to learn new skills and gain experience. Freelancing or completing small tasks can lead to new clients or projects, expanding an individual's portfolio and skill set.

"New York City has always been an expensive place to live. Between high rent prices, skyrocketing utility bills, and a cost of living that's well above the national average, it's not easy to make ends meet in the concrete jungle. But despite all these challenges, some residents are finding creative ways to make life a bit more affordable. One of the most popular options is to rent out a spare room or even their entire apartment on Airbnb. This allows them to make some extra money while providing affordable lodging to tourists and travelers.

Of course, there are those who argue that Airbnb is actually making housing more expensive and harder to find. They say that the platform allows landlords to take properties off the market for long periods of time, driving up prices and decreasing availability.

Firstly, the DNC knowingly favored the former Secretary of State over Senator Bernie Sanders, and leaked emails revealed that key party leaders actively worked to undermine Sanders' campaign. Secondly, Clinton supporters controlled the superdelegates, a small but critical group of party elites who ultimately decided the winner of the primary. This group openly supported Clinton even before the primaries began, making it incredibly difficult for Sanders to gain momentum and win the nomination. Furthermore, various voting irregularities, voter suppression and outright fraud were reported in several states that ultimately favored Clinton.

"In today's digital world, where people can hide behind the anonymity of their computer screens, hate speech has become prevalent across social media platforms. These platforms allow individuals to share their opinions, but in some cases, it can lead to harmful attacks on certain groups of people.

Such negativity online can lead to severe consequences and harm the emotional well-being of people. Several studies suggest that the rise in hate speech online is linked to increased mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, especially among adolescents. This proves how influential and devastating the impact of hate speech online can be.

Therefore, in the interest of public safety and to protect people's emotional and mental states, hate speech must be regulated and censored online. Technology has evolved to the point where companies should have the necessary infrastructure to detect and remove any harmful content.

"The problem of corruption has plagued the Asian continent for decades. Government officials and public servants are often found engaging in illicit activities such as accepting bribes, fraud, and embezzlement. These actions not only undermine the integrity of institutions, but they also lead to economic stagnation and underdevelopment. Therefore, the urgent need to reduce corruption in Asia requires a shift in cultural values towards transparency and accountability. 

To illustrate, Thailand implemented a new anti-corruption law in 1999 that mandated public officials and politicians to declare their assets and income annually. Similarly, in Singapore, public officials are held to high standards of accountability, and the country is renowned for its effective anti-corruption agency. Additionally, countries like Japan and South Korea have also successfully reduced corruption rates by creating specialized anti-corruption institutions and reinforcing laws that promote transparency and accountability. 

However, reducing corruption cannot be achieved by government actions alone. It requires a cultural shift towards ethical values that prioritize the greater good over personal gain.

"Consider this: the NBA has undergone significant changes since Michael Jordan played in the league. For one, the pace of the game has quickened, with teams scoring at a much faster rate than they did in Jordan's era. Additionally, the rise of analytics has seen an emphasis on efficiency, with players being urged to prioritize shooting from beyond the arc or near the rim. Jordan, who only made 32% of his career three-point attempts and shot 48% from the field, would have to adapt his game accordingly.

Moreover, the NBA's current crop of players is arguably much more skilled and athletic than Jordan's contemporaries. Increased specialisation in training means that many young players focus on specific aspects of the game.

"As I was sitting in the doctor’s office, he handed me a prescription for a new medication that had just hit the market. The price was astronomical, but he assured me that it was the most effective treatment available. When I asked about alternative options or natural remedies, he seemed dismissive and even warned me against them, calling them “ineffective” and “pseudo-science”. This experience made me wonder if he was genuinely prioritizing my health or if he was influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. 
Later, I did some research on my own and found that many of the drugs that were promoted as “breakthrough treatments” had little to no additional benefits compared to older, cheaper medications. In fact, some of them had serious side effects that were scary to think about. So why were doctors so quick to prescribe them? 
I realized that the answer was tied to the financial incentives that drug companies have to push certain products through the system.

In my experience, both pedestrians and cyclists can be reckless on the road. Giving them priority over cars would only increase the risk of accidents. 

In addition, cars are necessary for people who have to commute long distances or transport heavy items. It's not always feasible to walk or cycle, especially in extreme weather conditions.

After a long hike, my friends and I were excited to use the campground's ice machine to fill up our cooler. Little did we know that bacteria can also grow in ice cubes - something that I had never considered before.
After learning about how bacteria can be found in unexpected places like ice cubes and drinking water, I now take extra precautions to ensure my own safety and the safety of those around me. I always use a straw when drinking from a fountain or tap, and I never forget to wash my hands before handling ice or preparing food.

Seeing new discoveries and breakthroughs made in understanding our universe is always exciting, but it has become clear to me that the European Space Agency is not doing enough to advance this field. It's frustrating to see privatized space companies like SpaceX make leaps and bounds, while seemingly more bureaucratic organizations like ESA are dragging their feet. There are so many captivating questions left unanswered about space, such as the exact nature of black holes or the potential for life on other planets.

As I left the zoo, I couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt and sadness for supporting such an industry.

I believe that adopting a common language for all member states in the EU would significantly improve communication and cooperation among countries. This would not only enhance personal experiences but also create a more cohesive and efficient community. With a common language, people from different countries could easily work together, share ideas, and build relationships without the barrier of a language barrier. This would not only promote unity but would also strengthen the EU as a whole. 

Moreover, adopting a common language would also simplify processes such as trade, education, and governance. With a common language, documents could be easily translated, creating fewer barriers to cross-border trade and education. Communication would also be improved between different levels of governance, making it easier to implement common policies and build a sense of community across the EU.

"The Star Wars franchise has always been known for its complex and nuanced characters, with many fans finding hidden depths in even minor figures. While the introduction of Jar Jar Binks in the prequel trilogy was met with mixed reactions, some fans have taken things a step further by positing that the clumsy and lovable alien is secretly a Sith Lord. This theory, which has become known as ""Darth Jar Jar,"" has been circulating online for years and gained particular traction in the wake of Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm. Despite the enthusiasm of its proponents, however, there are a number of reasons to argue against the legitimacy of the theory.

First and foremost, it's worth noting that the evidence supporting the theory is largely circumstantial. While there are certainly moments in the films where Jar Jar exhibits behavior that could be interpreted as sinister (such as his apparent manipulation of events during the Battle of Naboo), there is no concrete proof that he is actually a Sith Lord.

Furthermore, the concept of Darth Jar Jar simply doesn't fit with the overall narrative of the Star Wars saga. The prequel trilogy focuses heavily on the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker, with the Clone Wars serving as a backdrop to his tragic story. Introducing a major plot twist like Jar Jar being a Sith Lord would not only be jarring, but would detract from the emotional weight of Anakin's journey.

Finally, it's worth considering the logistics of how such a reveal would work within the Star Wars universe. If Jar Jar is a Sith Lord, why has he spent so much time seemingly bumbling around and getting in the way? How has he managed to survive for so long without being discovered? And why has he never made any overt moves to aid the Sith in their quest for galactic domination?

Ultimately, while the Darth Jar Jar theory is a fun and creative idea, it simply doesn't hold up under scrutiny.", Darth Jar Jar is a legitimate theory.,AGAINST,5,AGAINST

"Recently, there have been numerous reports of AI malfunctioning and causing harm to humans. In March 2018, an autonomous Uber vehicle killed a pedestrian in Arizona, bringing into question the safety of autonomous technology. Additionally, there have been cases of robots injuring factory workers due to programming errors or mechanical malfunctions. As such, the idea of relying on AI to produce and distribute our food supply raises concerns about the potential for harm and error. 

Furthermore, the potential cost of implementing AI technology in the food industry may be prohibitive, especially for small-scale farmers and producers. AI requires expensive hardware and software, as well as trained technicians to oversee its functioning. For many smaller businesses, this investment may be out of reach, leaving them at a disadvantage in the market and potentially driving them out of business. 

In addition, the use of AI in food production and distribution may further exacerbate issues of inequality and food insecurity. In many regions of the world, access to food is already limited by factors such as poverty, political instability, and climate change. If AI is used primarily by large corporations and industries, it may lead to further marginalization of small-scale farmers and producers, ultimately limiting access to food for vulnerable populations.", AI can revolutionize the way we produce and distribute food.,AGAINST,5,AGAINST

Islamic education incorporates a wide range of subjects, including science, mathematics, literature, and history. These subjects are taught in a way that is consistent with Islamic values and principles, but they are not used to indoctrinate or brainwash students.

In fact, Islamic education is built on the foundation of critical thinking and questioning. From an early age, students are encouraged to ask questions and seek knowledge. This is because Islam emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge as a means of better understanding and worshipping God.

Islamic education also places a strong emphasis on moral and ethical values. Students are taught about the importance of compassion, kindness, and respect for others. They are encouraged to treat others as they would like to be treated and to work towards creating a more just and equitable society.

In addition to academic subjects and moral values, Islamic education also places a strong emphasis on community service and social responsibility. Students are taught about the importance of giving back to society and serving those in need. This helps to instill a sense of civic responsibility and encourages students to become active and engaged members of their communities.

Moreover, the blockchain technology is still not fully understood by the public and governments. Its complexity and lack of user-friendliness make it hard to implement in government systems. Governments would require blockchain experts to implement the technology on a large scale, which would be expensive and time-consuming.

Additionally, governments provide several essential services that cannot be taken over by blockchain technology.

"According to statistics, fathers face an uphill battle in custody cases, with mothers being awarded physical custody nearly 70% of the time.

This makes it incredibly difficult for fathers to defend themselves and prove their innocence. The repercussions of being falsely accused of domestic violence can be devastating, including loss of visitation rights and even criminal charges. Additionally, these false allegations can harm the children involved, causing emotional trauma and upheaval in their lives.

"Recently, superhero movies have become synonymous with box office success and have garnered a loyal fanbase. With the rise of feminism, there has been a focus on empowering female characters and giving them their own standalone movies. However, the issue with Captain Marvel is that she has been deemed too overpowered, making it hard for audiences to relate to her. Unlike other superheroes who had to earn their powers or had weaknesses, Captain Marvel seemed to have it all from the beginning. 

This lack of vulnerability has left no room for character development and has made her more of an action figure rather than a fully fleshed-out character. As viewers, we want to see heroes encounter challenges, make sacrifices and face consequences. These are integral to the storytelling process of any superhero movie, but the issue with Captain Marvel is that these elements are lacking. 

Moreover, the fact that she is overpowered has led to a lack of tension and urgency in her fights. The audience already knows she will emerge victorious, making it hard to get invested in her battles. Characters like Iron Man and Thor have had to work hard to develop their powers and have faced defeat and loss, making their victories more meaningful. Comparatively, Captain Marvel's victories feel like par for the course.

"Many rivers around the world are being dammed for hydropower purposes. These dams, in turn, lead to significant disruptions to the ecosystem. The construction of hydropower dams can cause massive flooding, leading to the destruction of wildlife habitats and entire ecosystems. The fish populations of rivers are also drastically affected by hydropower as dams prevent fish from moving naturally up and down rivers during migration seasons. This leads to a decline in fish populations and can even lead to extinction. Furthermore, the release of water from these dams can cause significant changes in river flow, which can affect the water temperature and overall water chemistry. These changes can have a negative impact on the river's flora and fauna, causing long-term damage to the ecosystem.", The Boston Celtics intentionally lost games to improve their draft position.,NONE,5,FAVOR
"Given the current state of drug-related crimes in Europe, it is evident that current strategies for combating the issue have not been effective. Incarceration has proved to exacerbate problems related to addiction and can actually increase crime rates. A change in strategy for lower level drug offenses and the legalization of marijuana may be an effective approach. In countries like Portugal, where all drugs have been decriminalized since 2001, there have been significant decreases in drug use and related crimes. Legalizing marijuana would allow governments to regulate the substance and decrease the influence of illegal black markets. Additionally, it would reduce the burden on law enforcement who could then focus on more pressing issues. The prison system in Europe is already overcrowded and legalizing marijuana would prevent unnecessary incarcerations for small drug offenses.

"The increase in global temperature has been a natural phenomenon since the last Ice Age. Natural factors such as volcanic eruptions, solar variation, and changes in Earth's orbit have played a pivotal role in shaping the climate. Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, are essential for trapping some of the sun's heat and keeping the planet habitable. However, the contribution of humans to the greenhouse effect is relatively insignificant compared to natural processes that encompass the entire Earth system. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, considered as the primary greenhouse gas, is only about 0.04% of the total composition of the atmosphere. Besides, significant and well-documented climate changes in the past, such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, were not caused by the increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

"The educational system needs to be more inclusive for people who do not want to pursue a career in mathematics or science. Mathematics, especially higher levels of it, can be difficult and intimidating for many people. Group theory, matrices, and other advanced algebraic concepts are rarely used outside of academia or research fields. 

Most people will never need to use advanced algebraic concepts in their daily lives. Instead, more practical topics like personal finance, basic statistics, and coding should be taught in high school and college. This would better prepare students for the real world and give them the skills they need to succeed. 

It is more important for individuals to master basic mathematical skills such as arithmetic and geometry, which are essential for everyday life. These skills have real-world applications, from splitting a bill at a restaurant to calculating the area of a room for renovations. 

Moreover, even within STEM fields, not all branches of math are equally important. While fields such as engineering and physics rely heavily on algebraic concepts, other fields like biology or psychology may not need them at all. Instead, these fields might use more probability and statistics, which are more relevant to their respective areas.

The Last Jedi was supposed to continue his story, but instead, it turned him into a pathetic old man who had lost all hope.
