"Many have already said this, but I wish to add my voice to their complaint: it is extremely misleading to say that ""all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants."" Furthermore, even if you were to issue the more accurate statement that ""immigrants have seen a net gain in employment compared to 2007, while native-born Americans have seen a net loss,"" you would still be intentionally misleading your readers, and here's why: By omission, you are implying that the gains of immigrants and the losses of native-born Americans are directly intertwined. In some ways, perhaps they are. However, you are ignoring the fact that the economy shed 8.7 MILLION jobs in the ""Great Recession,"" having to do primarily with the recklessness of our financial services industry and almost nothing to do with immigrants.

Washington state has legal marijuana stores, but, just like the stores here that sell alcohol, you will not find heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine next to it on the shelf. Also, marijuana use was pervasive in Washington state well before it was legalized and arrest, incarceration and criminal records destroyed the lives and futures of far more people, especially young black and hispanic men, than smoking a bit of weed.

Certainly a lot of the folks who are gung ho on their local high school football and basketball programs don't give much of a damn about the academics of those students anyway so long as they can have a winning team. Let's set up something elsewhere and let the rest of our kids concentrate on getting an education that will enable them to do something besides playing sports!",I am in favor of a 'safe and anonymous dating ! ,NONE

"My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick.

When they are young they learn to make choices, albeit small choices, and as they get older the choices become more significant and important. i think the type of parenting described in the book is extreme and not the best path for parents to follow",I am in favor of dual citizenship ! ,NONE

No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor.

"Of course individuals with dual citizenship can be model citizens, that is until the policies of their two countries conflict. Those things don't normally happen for most people, unless they work for the government. My wife had dual citizenship, but when she began working for the U.S. Department of State she was asked to renounce the non-US one in order to get a security clearance. Back in my military career, it was common for foreign nationals to enlist, but hey did not get a Secret clearance until they became U.S. citizens and renounced their birth citizenship. That clearance was critical to becoming a non-commissioned officer or commissioned officer. Maybe the Congresswoman found out she would also lose her clearance if she kept here non-US citizenship, and that would put her seat on the House Select Committee on Intelligence in question.

"OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP!

So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam.

"The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children.

The other in-state schools are less expensive, but do not provide the same quality of education. Out-of-state public universities and private schools cost much more money, making these options harder for students to pursue. This doesn't seem like a wise education policy. The State of California ends up with a large number of students who are less educated, have higher debt rates, or leave the state permanently.",I am in favor of America being attacked by Islamist terrorists ! ,NONE

"There is a similar system in the UK. All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week. This ensures that children are well-socialized and exposed to group environments before they start school, which is at the age of 4 / turning 5 in the UK. Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st.

"There is no economic argument for taxing income differently, depending on its source; income is income. Such arguments as we typically hear are theological debates, whose partisans hope to pave their way to a personal vision of heaven. The double taxation argument is groundless; in the first case there are many other examples of double taxation, and in the second empirical evidence does not support conservative claims about disincentives. One could also argue that the tax on labor is a disincentive to work, but for some reason that seems to have less traction - could it be because wealthy people - whose right to speak more loudly than the rest of us was recently codified by the Supreme Court - are less concerned about it?

"This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses.

This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses. Even if condo owners and developers get a tax abatement during the initial years, these expire and they end up paying substantially higher taxes overall. The system is patently unfair to condo owners, and this article is simply dishonest!",I am in favor of using income to measure wealth ! ,NONE

"When I was in 6th grade, my teacher asked the class to identify the most important thing to learn in school. There were lots of suggestions - reading, math, history, how to write well, spelling, etc. It wasn't until someone said ""to learn how to learn"" that she was satisfied with the answer.
